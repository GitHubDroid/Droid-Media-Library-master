# Droid Media Library

This project is an android application to keep track of movie, book, and game
collections. It works by scanning the barcode of just about anything and
looking it up on upcdatabase.com, then storing its name and description. Users
can then search for media, or scan something to see if they own it or not.
(This was a problem for myself and a friend of mine, I own more than a hundred
DVDs, and he owns several hundred.)
